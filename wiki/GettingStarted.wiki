=Steps to get started=

==Step 1:==


Add the framework to your page(s).  You could use this to stay up to date with latest versions or download and 
manually update it.

	<script src="http://resources.jacquespagels.com/apis/social/apiSocial_Latest.js"></script>



==Step 2:==


Once you have a Facebook APP key Insatiate the framework and update your default settings.

	S.Init({api:"Facebook",data:{"AppKey":320646637979079}});



==Step 3:==


Call a method you wish to carry out.

	var data = {
		name:"Name of the feed", 
		caption:"A short caption about the post", 
		link:"A link to your App or website."
	};

	S.Facebook("feed", data);


Thats it...you're done! :-)



Feel free to pass it around and let me know if you would like to add functionality to it.  I'm all about making the 
lives of developers and my life easier.

    Note:

	This is a rough draft of the framework - so rough it doesn't even have a name yet - so over the next few months 
	functionality will be added and code will be cleant up, refactored and optimised.
